## Functions

- Functions are declared using the fn keyword.
- Its arguments are type annotated, just like variables, and, if the function returns a value, the return type must be
  specified after an arrow ->.
- The final expression in the function will be used as return value.
- Alternatively, the return statement can be used to return a value earlier from within the function, even from inside
  loops or if statements.

## Associated functions & Methods

- Some functions are connected to a particular type.
- These come in two forms: associated functions, and methods.
- Associated functions are functions that are defined on a type generally,
- Methods are associated functions that are called on a particular instance of a type.
