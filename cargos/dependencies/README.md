## Dependencies
- Most programs have dependencies on some libraries.
- If you have ever managed dependencies by hand, you know how much of a pain this can be. Luckily, the Rust ecosystem comes standard with cargo! cargo can manage dependencies for a project.

To create a new Rust project,
```
# A binary project
cargo new app

# A library project
cargo new --lib utils

```
- For the rest of this chapter, let's assume we are making a binary, rather than a library, but all of the concepts are the same.
- After the above commands, you should see a file hierarchy like this:

```
.
├── utils
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
└── app
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

- The main.rs is the root source file for your new foo project -- nothing new there. 
- The Cargo.toml is the config file for cargo for this project. 
- If you look inside it, you should see something like this:

```
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["mark"]

[dependencies]
```

- The name field under [package] determines the name of the project. 
- This is used by crates.io if you publish the crate (more later). 
- It is also the name of the output binary when you compile.

- The version field is a crate version number using Semantic Versioning.
- The authors field is a list of authors used when publishing the crate.
- The [dependencies] section lets you add dependencies for your project.
- For example, suppose that we want our program to have a great CLI. 
- You can find lots of great packages on crates.io (the official Rust package registry).
- One popular choice is clap. As of this writing, the most recent published version of clap is 2.27.1. 
- To add a dependency to our program, we can simply add the following to our Cargo.toml under [dependencies]: clap = "2.27.1".
- And that's it! You can start using clap in your program.

<br>

- cargo also supports other types of dependencies. Here is just a small sampling:

```
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["mark"]

[dependencies]
clap = "2.27.1" # from crates.io
rand = { git = "https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand" } # from online repo
utils = { path = "../utils" } # from a path in the local filesystem

```

- cargo is more than a dependency manager.
- All of the available configuration options are listed in the format specification of Cargo.toml.
- To build our project we can execute cargo build anywhere in the project directory (including subdirectories!).
- We can also do cargo run to build and run. 
- Notice that these commands will resolve all dependencies, download crates if needed, and build everything, including your crate. 
- (Note that it only rebuilds what it has not already built, similar to make).

Voila! That's all there is to it!
