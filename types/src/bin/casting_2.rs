fn main() {
    // Since rust-lang 1.45, the `as` keyword performs a *saturating cast*
    // when casting from float to int. If the floating point value exceeds
    // the upper bound or is less than the lower bound, the returned value
    // will be equal to the bound crossed.

    // This behavior incurs a small runtime cost and can be avoided
    // with unsafe methods, however the results might overflow and
    // return **unsound values**. Use these methods wisely:
    unsafe {
        // 300.0 as u8 is 44
        println!(" 300.0 as u8 is : {}", 300.0_f32.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // -100.0 as u8 is 156
        println!(
            "-100.0 as u8 is : {}",
            (-100.0_f32).to_int_unchecked::<u8>()
        );
        // nan as u8 is 0
        println!("   nan as u8 is : {}", f32::NAN.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
    }
