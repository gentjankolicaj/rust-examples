## Attributes

An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item. This metadata can be used to/for:

- conditional compilation of code
- set crate name, version and type (binary or library)
- disable lints (warnings)
- enable compiler features (macros, glob imports, etc.)
- link to a foreign library
- mark functions as unit tests
- mark functions that will be part of a benchmark
- attribute like macros
- Attributes look like #[outer_attribute] or #![inner_attribute], with the difference between them being where they apply.

- **#[outer_attribute]** applies to the item immediately following it. Some examples of items are: a function, a module declaration, a constant, a structure, an enum.
- Here is an example where attribute #[derive(Debug)] applies to the struct Rectangle:
```
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
```

- **#![inner_attribute]** applies to the enclosing item (typically a module or a crate). In other words, this attribute is interpreted as applying to the entire scope in which it's placed.
- Here is an example where #![allow(unused_variables)] applies to the whole crate (if placed in main.rs):

```
#![allow(unused_variables)]

fn main() {
    let x = 3; // This would normally warn about an unused variable.
}

```

Attributes can take arguments with different syntaxes:

- **#[attribute = "value"]**
- **#[attribute(key = "value")]**
- **#[attribute(value)]**


Attributes can have multiple values and can be separated over multiple lines, too:

- **#[attribute(value, value2)]**
- **#[attribute(value, value2, value3,value4, value5)]**
